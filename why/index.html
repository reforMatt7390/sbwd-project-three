            Although there are many issues I'd like to see addressed, here are few topics that my
            constituents have brought to my attention:

            It's no secret that SGA has had its fair share of setbacks.  I'd like to start by
            addressing the shortcomings within our Bylaws and Constitution.  My recently proposed
            Governmental Affairs Committee was overwhelmingly approved and will address these issues
            quickly and thoroughly.

            Additionally, the External Affairs Subcommittee is tasked with representing the Illinois
            Tech SGA locally, regionally, or even nationally in community service and collaboration
            with organizations outside of IIT.

            Transparency.  Students have voiced many concerns about the lack of transparency between
            SGA and student body.  I hope to address this issue by inviting students without SGA
            affiliation to participate in committees, and releasing any/all information (not deemed
            confidential) to the student body, encouraging more open dialogues.  Although the Exec
            Board meets in private, I also encourage them to post minutes on any non-confidential
            matters.
          </p>
          <p class="p-integrity-2">
            SGA Voting Records.  Senators are responsible for representing the interests of their
            college, and the student body must be able to hold senators accountable! I would like
            to implement a voting record (via iClickers) so that our senators votes can be
            recorded and made available to the students. At any time, the student body could
            review a senators voting record to ensure that their interests are being represented
            by their senators and hold SGA accountable.

            Student orgs should be equally accessible to ALL students, even those who come from
            low-income families, are the first in their family to attend college, or come from
            other underserved communities.

            Start a bonus points "drive" (like a food drive... but instead of collecting canned
            goods we'll collect bonus points and/or non-perishables purchased with bonus points).
