        <h4>Who am I?</h4>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Matt!  I’m currently a member of the SGA Student Life Committee, where our team is
          working on the Student Organization Accessibility Project. At my previous college, I held
          numerous positions including Service Chair, Fellowship Chair, and Vice President at an
          award-winning chapter of Phi Theta. I’ve served as a leader inside the classroom as a
          Supplemental Instructor.
        </p>
        <p>
          My teamwork and leadership experience extends into the professional world too. I took a
          break from college and spent a few years managing large hotels and restaurants. There, I
          gained professional experience leading small and large teams, throwing lit parties/event
          planning, balancing P&L/financial statements, and managing the overall execution of a
          multimillion dollar department at a first-class hospitality firm.  I have a unique
          combination of leadership and team experience in both academic and professional settings.
