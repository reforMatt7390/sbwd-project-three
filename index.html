          Hi, I'm Matt!  I’m currently a member of the SGA Student Life Committee, where our team is working on the
          Student Organization Accessibility Project (add another page for this during Project #3).
          At my previous college, I held numerous positions including Service Chair, Fellowship
          Chair, and Vice President at an award-winning chapter of Phi Theta.  I’ve served as a
          leader inside the classroom as a Supplemental Instructor.
        </p>
        <p class="p-intro-2">
          My teamwork and leadership experience extends into the professional world too. I took a
          break from college and spent a few years managing large hotels and restaurants. There, I
          gained professional experience leading small and large teams, throwing lit parties/event
          planning, balancing P&L/financial statements, and managing the overall execution of a
          multimillion dollar department at a first-class hospitality firm.  I have a unique
          combination of leadership and team experience in both academic and professional settings.
